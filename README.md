# CHIP-8-Interpreter
 My First Chip-8 Interpreter, it is made with C++
 It is very very close to being regular C, but I got lazy.
 No quality of life here, just baby's first interpreter.

Command Line Arguments:
- -660
	- makes program data start at memory location 0x600 instead of 0x200
- "example file name.ch8"
	- makes the interpreter load a file of this name, it must end in ".ch8", and probably needs to be in the same directory as the executable
